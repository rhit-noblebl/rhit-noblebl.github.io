    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <image src="images/avatar.png" />
    <p>My name is Braydon Noble. I am a Computer Science student currently in my Sophomore year at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology. I am also currently looking
      for an internship, and you can see some of my credentials over on my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> page.
    </p>
      
    <p>Other than more professional descriptions of myself, I like doing a variety of
      activities, my favorite of which being the stereotypical answer of video games. I play Super Smash Bros Ultimate semi-competitively, and even went to Super Smash Con 2023
      and was highlighted on stream! A couple image examples can be seen below:

    <p>This is me on stage. I was highlighted on their stream view.</p>

    <image src="images/tweet.jpg"/>
    <p>This is after the competition. I was called on stage by the best SSBM Donkey Kong player in the world and got a picture which they tweeted out.</p>
    <p>
        This is just my main passion though. On top of video games, I have a couple more hobbies. I make bead art occasionally, and am also trying to learn both how to play the piano and chess. 
        You can see more of my work on my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page.
