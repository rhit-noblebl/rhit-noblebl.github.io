    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>This is a collection of a couple of projects I have done over the years. This is not very extensive, but it is a decent list.</p>
    <ul id="portfolioItems">
      <li>
        <h2><a href="index.html">This Very Website</a></h2>
        <img src="images/website.png"/>
        <p>Yup. I coded this website. Yippee</p>
      </li>

        <h2><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371">Friday Night Funkin' Multiplayer Modding</a></h2>
        <img src="images/fnf.png"/>
        <p>Edited a pre-existing Multiplayer Mod to include over 50 new songs, and 50 new characters on top of the additional content not usually accessible outside
          of the base game. The screenshot is taken from my mod, though it is not currently deployed anywhere, so I linked the base game above instead. 
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/hbhare/some_mother_3_beadsprites_i_made_repost_because_i/">Bead Art</a></h2>
        <img src="images/mother3.png"/>
        <p>Made lots of bead art. Showcased above is the collection I made based on one of my favorite games, Mother 3. The link above goes to my Reddit post about it.

        <h2><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198100743118/">A lot of gaming</a></h2>
        <img src="images/steam.png"/>
        <p>I do play a lot of games. Linked is my Steam profile which contains more information on my game history.

        <h2><button id="get-text-btn">Required JavaScript Integration</button></h2>
        <p>So as part of this project, we're supposed to have some sort of JavaScript feature. So I looked up some things and the easiest one to integrate seems to be 
          a random text generator. So I made it so that when you click the above button, this text below will change! (To be honest a lot of this is copied from either
          our old work or StackOverflow, but hey, it works)
        </p>
